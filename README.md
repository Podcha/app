## About The Project
Podcha is decentralized platform where you can find, collect and listen to the worldâ€™s best podcasts.

## Idea

Podcha hosts podcast content and allows to support favorite creators on the decentralized internet, without any controlling platform in the middle. No more getting banned and losing access to all followers or content at the whims of large platform companies.

With Podcha, users are in control of their data: the social graph is on the blockchain, and all audio or video is stored and hosted in a peer to peer platform.

For the social graph, we use Lens, an interoperable standard for creating social media platforms and applications in web3. Both profiles and follows are NFTs on the Polygon network.

Regarding the data: this is stored in IPFS, a peer to peer service for hosting content on the internet. So creators, listeners and any other 'pinning' service pay all help with hosting the content.
